/**
 * Reducer Manager: dynamic Redux reducer injection
 *
 * Redux's combineReducers() is static—you pass a fixed object and it never changes.
 * Here we need to add reducers when a feature window opens and remove them when
 * the last window of that type closes. The reducer manager:
 *
 * 1. Holds a mutable map of reducers and rebuilds the combined reducer when
 *    add() or remove() is called.
 * 2. Exposes a single reduce(state, action) that behaves like a normal root reducer
 *    but delegates to the current combined reducer.
 * 3. On remove(), we don't delete the key from state immediately (that would mutate
 *    state inside reduce). We queue keys in keysToRemove and strip them at the
 *    start of the next reduce() call, then run the new combined reducer so the
 *    removed slice's state is gone.
 *
 * Used by: store (as the root reducer), lazyLoadReducer / removeLazyLoadedReducer.
