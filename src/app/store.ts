/**
 * Store setup with dynamic reducer injection.
 *
 * The root reducer is not a static combineReducers(...). It is the reducer
 * manager's reduce function, which can change over time as we add/remove
 * feature slices (see reducerManager.ts). We attach the manager to the store
 * so that lazyLoadReducer and removeLazyLoadedReducer can call add/remove and
 * then replaceReducer(manager.reduce) to apply the new root reducer.
